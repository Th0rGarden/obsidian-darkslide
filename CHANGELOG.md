# Changelog

All notable changes to DarkSlide will be documented in this file.

## [1.0.1] - 2025-01-30

### Fixed
- **Modal backdrop transparency**: Fixed an issue where modal backdrops (settings windows, prompts, etc.) were completely opaque instead of showing the proper semi-transparent darkening/blur effect. Modal backdrops now correctly preserve their transparency and blur while the modal content itself still receives the brightness adjustment.

## [1.0.0] - 2025-01-29

### Added
- Initial release
- Status bar slider for quick brightness adjustment
- Settings panel with brightness slider
- Live preview of brightness changes
- Support for -100 to +100 brightness range
- Auto-save functionality
- Per-vault settings persistence
- Comprehensive coverage of workspace, sidebars, tabs, and modals
- Plugin CSS variable overrides for compatibility
