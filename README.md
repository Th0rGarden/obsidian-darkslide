## 💡 Tips

- **Make it darker**: Try values between -30 to -70 for a deeper, more focused dark mode
- **Make it brighter**: Values between +20 to +50 can help if your theme is too dim
- **Reset anytime**: Click the "Reset" button in settings to return to 0 (theme default)
- **Auto-save**: Your preference saves automatically when you release the slider
- **Per-vault**: Each vault remembers its own brightness setting
