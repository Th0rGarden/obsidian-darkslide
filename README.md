2. Navigate to your vault's plugins folder:
   - **Windows**: `C:\path\to\your\vault\.obsidian\plugins\`
   - **macOS/Linux**: `/path/to/your/vault/.obsidian/plugins/`
3. Create a new folder called `darkslide`
4. Place both downloaded files (`main.js` and `manifest.json`) inside the `darkslide` folder
5. Restart Obsidian or reload community plugins
6. Go to Settings ‚Üí Community Plugins
7. Enable "DarkSlide"

**Having trouble finding the plugins folder?**
- In Obsidian, open Settings ‚Üí About

- Navigate to `.obsidian/plugins/` from there

## üí° Tips

- **Make it darker**: Try values between -30 to -70 for a deeper, more focused dark mode
- **Make it brighter**: Values between +20 to +50 can help if your theme is too dim
- **Reset anytime**: Click the "Reset" button in settings to return to 0 (theme default)
- **Auto-save**: Your preference saves automatically when you release the slider
- **Per-vault**: Each vault remembers its own brightness setting
