# DarkSlide

**Dial in the perfect brightness for any Obsidian theme.**

Ever find a theme you love, but it's just a bit too dark? Or maybe it's too bright when you're working late at night? DarkSlide adds a simple slider to your status bar that lets you adjust how dark or light your theme looks—without actually switching themes.

> **Important note:** This isn't a theme switcher. It adjusts the brightness of whatever theme you're already using. Think of it like a brightness dial for your current theme.

## When you might use this

I made this because I kept finding themes I liked, but they were always just a bit too dark or too bright for different times of day. Maybe you:

- Love a theme but it's too dark for daytime work
- Have a dark theme that's not quite dark enough
- Want to go extra dark for focus sessions without switching themes
- Work in different lighting throughout the day
- Just like tweaking things until they feel right

## How to use it

DarkSlide adds a brightness slider to your status bar (bottom right corner of Obsidian, next to a sun icon ☀️).

**Drag left** to make things darker, **drag right** to make things brighter, or **click the reset button** (↺) to return to normal.

Changes happen instantly as you move the slider.

Each theme remembers its own brightness setting. 

It works everywhere—the editor, sidebars, tabs, modals, and plugin panels—without modifying theme files.

## Installation

DarkSlide is pending approval for the Obsidian Community Plugins marketplace.

### Install with BRAT (recommended)

1. Install the [BRAT plugin](https://github.com/TfTHacker/obsidian42-brat)
2. Open command palette (Ctrl/Cmd + P)
3. Run "BRAT: Add a beta plugin for testing"
4. Enter: `Th0rGarden/obsidian-darkslide`
5. Enable DarkSlide in Settings → Community Plugins

## What's new in v1.1

- Added a reset button to the status bar slider
- Each theme now remembers its own brightness
- Tweaked how colors are calculated

## A quick note

This plugin works by applying a color overlay to backgrounds. It works well with most themes, but some themes with very specific styling might not respond perfectly to the adjustment. If you find one that doesn't work right, let me know.
