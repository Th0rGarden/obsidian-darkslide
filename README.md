# DarkSlide

**Dial in the perfect brightness for any Obsidian theme.**

Ever find a theme you love, but it's just a bit too dark? Or maybe it's too bright when you're working late at night? DarkSlide adds a simple slider to your status bar that lets you precisely adjust how dark or light your theme looks.

## How to use it

DarkSlide adds a slider to your status bar (bottom right corner, next to a sun icon ☀️).

**Drag** the slider to adjust brightness. **Click the toggle button** (◐) to switch to contrast mode. **Click reset** (↺) to return to defaults.

Changes happen instantly. Each theme remembers its own brightness and contrast settings.

It works everywhere—the editor, sidebars, tabs, modals, and plugin panels—without modifying theme files.

## Installation

DarkSlide is pending approval for the Obsidian Community Plugins marketplace.

### Install with BRAT (recommended)

1. Install the [BRAT plugin](https://github.com/TfTHacker/obsidian42-brat)
2. Open command palette (Ctrl/Cmd + P)
3. Run "BRAT: Add a beta plugin for testing"
4. Enter: `Th0rGarden/obsidian-darkslide`
5. Enable DarkSlide in Settings → Community Plugins

## What's new in v1.2

- **Contrast control**: New contrast slider lets you adjust contrast independently from brightness (20-200%)
- **Dual-mode status bar**: Toggle between brightness and contrast controls directly in the status bar
- **Revamped settings**: Cleaner settings panel with separate controls for brightness and contrast
- **Per-theme contrast**: Each theme remembers its own contrast setting, just like brightness
- **Status bar toggle**: Option to hide the status bar slider if you prefer using the settings panel

## What's new in v1.1

- Added a reset button to the status bar slider
- Each theme now remembers its own brightness
- Tweaked how colors are calculated

## A quick note

This plugin works by applying a color overlay to backgrounds. It works well with most themes, but some themes with very specific styling might not respond perfectly to the adjustment. If you find one that doesn't work right, let me know.
